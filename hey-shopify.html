		<h1 class="letter__title">Hey Shopify</h1>
		<section class="letter__container">
			<p>
				My name is Kathleen Robertson and I am a UX Designer. I am currently in the process of relocating from Edmonton back to my hometown of Ottawa. Because of this move I am now looking to establish my career in Ottawa. I have award winning and professional client experience as demonstrated in <a href="http://www.kathleenrobertson.ca">my portfolio.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				While researching companies in Ottawa, Shopify quickly became top of my list of places I would be interested in working at. Shopify has the values of a company that resonate very strongly with my personal beliefs and values. The mission and culture that Shopify sets out to create is one that I would be proud to be a part of and the skills I have in UX design would be a great fit for a role as part of the Shopify team.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my most recent role as a UX Designer at the Alberta Motor Association (AMA) I have learned a lot about what is important to me in a company. AMA has shown me just how valuable being on a team with other passionate individuals really is. The team at AMA is unlike any other I have worked on before, but now hope to try to find a team that is similar and I believe Shopify to be that place.
			</p>
			<p>
				AMA is one of the largest Ruby on Rails shops in Edmonton. I have learned a lot about Ruby while working on a multidisciplinary team that not only included developers but also usability specialists, product owners, support personnel, and content specialists. Being able to pair with co-workers throughout the entire lifecycle of a feature has changed the way I am able to create user experiences. From research, to wire-framing, to front-end development and creating prototypes for user testing, the UX process that I’ve learned to love would not be possible without such a dedicated and passionate team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through learning the Agile process I have seen first hand the value of having transparency, trust and friendship in a team. It has taught me to think outside the box, to not be afraid to ask for help or input when I need it, and to truly trust and be excited for the work that is being created around me. The term ‘Trust Battery’ was not one that I had heard before reading more about Shopify. But it is absolutely a concept I have experienced from both sides. Being able to have your managers, product owners and teammates intrinsically trust that you are going to try your best at something is very empowering. It drives me to ensure I am in fact putting my all in and living up to that trust that they have instilled in me.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am extremely passionate about UX design. The pride and spirit I exemplify in my work is one that I feel I would be able to share at Shopify with confidence. I would love to meet with you to tell you more about myself, learn more about Shopify, and discuss how I came to be as passionate for this career as I am.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you and stay awesome,
			</p>
			<p>
				Kathleen Robertson
